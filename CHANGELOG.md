# Changelog of BUSMASTER-NG

All user-visible changes of BUSMASTER-NG, newest first. Numbers like #2 are issues of
[teoCLMR/busmaster-ng](https://github.com/teoCLMR/busmaster-ng/issues); "original issue 1213" refers to
[rbei-etas/busmaster](https://github.com/rbei-etas/busmaster/issues).

The history of the original BUSMASTER up to v3.2.x is in [docs/history](docs/history) (ETAS, not changed).

## 3.4.2 "Overdrive" - 2026-10-30

Installer and packaging release: the program is the same as 3.4.1, with a clearer start-up message and the IXXAT
driver included.

**Downloads**
- An **installer** again, `BUSMASTER-NG_3.4.2_setup.exe`, for Windows 7 SP1, 10 and 11: for all users or only for
  you, with Start menu entries (BUSMASTER-NG, Format Converter, read-me), an optional desktop icon and an uninstaller.
  It installs the Visual C++ 2013 runtime when it is missing and, on Windows 7 only, the Universal C runtime.
- Two **portable zips** instead of one, with the same program: `_win32.zip` for Windows 10 / 11 (lighter: these
  versions of Windows already have the Universal C runtime) and `_win32_win7.zip` for Windows 7 SP1.
- In the zips the licenses and the change log are in a `Docs` folder, so the main folder is tidier. `Docs` also
  contains `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` with the licenses of the bundled components (libxml2, zlib, DMGraph, ...) and the
  list of interface vendor libraries; build by-products (`.map` files) are no longer included.
- The **IXXAT VCI** driver (`CAN_IXXAT_VCI.dll`) is in the package; it was missing because it needs the SDK of the
  Ixxat VCI driver to be built. Not tested with real IXXAT hardware yet.

**Start-up**
- If the *Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x86)* is not installed, BUSMASTER-NG says so, in Italian or
  English, and offers to open the Microsoft download page, instead of the bare Windows error "msvcr120.dll is
  missing".

**Note on updating**
- Window positions and the last configuration are stored per version, so after updating from 3.4.1 load your
  configuration once (*File → Load*).

**Project**
- The release packages are built by GitHub Actions from the tagged sources (see the README).

## 3.4.1 "Overdrive" - 2026-10-29

Bug fix release. Update recommended for everyone who uses the Simulation driver.

**Reliability**
- The program no longer hangs on the splash screen with the Simulation driver on a PC where BUSMASTER was never
  installed: the simulation engine `BusEmulation.exe` is registered for the current user when needed (no
  administrator rights), and if it still cannot be started a message says why (#7).

**Configuration**
- No "Do you want to save?" on exit when no configuration file is loaded (first start) and nothing was changed
  (#3).

**User interface**
- The main window no longer opens with its title bar above the top edge of the screen: it opens maximized the
  first time, then as it was when closed, and a restored window always lies inside a monitor (#8).
- The close button (X) of the Message Window hides it, like the *Message Window* button of the ribbon (#9).
- Message Window: the columns open wide enough for their titles at any display scale (they were measured with the
  wrong font and showed "Ti...", "Ch...").

**Note on updating**
- Window positions and the last configuration are stored per version, so after updating from 3.4.0 load your
  configuration once (*File → Load*).

## 3.4.0 "Overdrive" - 2026-10-28

Changes marked *(not tested yet)* are built but still waiting for the test listed in their issue; test reports are
welcome.

**Databases**
- Message window and Signal Watch show the value descriptions of CAN signals again ("Position control" instead of
  3) (#1).
- CAN database editor (#2):
  - factor and offset are kept with full precision: a factor such as 0.0000001 is no longer saved as 0, and
    editing a signal no longer cuts the offset to 2 decimals (original issues 932, 1248, 1308);
  - Signal Details: physical minimum and maximum can be typed with decimals; the raw range stored in the database
    follows (1296, 215);
  - no false "Maximum value cannot be less than minimum value" for unsigned hexadecimal values (1213);
  - the position of the signal (LSB, MSB and the start bit of a DBC file) is shown, and the Motorola error message
    explains the convention (1315);
  - Save As keeps a path with a dot in a folder name (1210);
  - the editor opens big enough, the message tree is visible and the window can be resized (1337).

**Node simulation**
- Works with a current MinGW (tested with WinLibs GCC 16.2.0, 32 bit); BUSMASTER-NG finds a `MinGW` folder next to
  `BUSMASTER.exe` and says clearly what is missing (#4). See the wiki page *Node simulation*.
- J1939 nodes: `SetTimeout` is declared with its right name (it was `SetTimout`), and the include guard of
  `Common.h` is fixed (original pull request 1136 by jogo-).

**Configuration**
- Open and Save dialogs remember the last folder for each kind of file (configuration, DBC, database, log, nodes,
  ...) instead of one folder for everything *(not tested yet, #3)*.
- The LIN driver and the visibility of the status bar are saved in the configuration (original issues 724, 1020,
  546) *(not tested yet, #3)*.
- No "Do you want to save?" on exit when nothing was changed (1004) *(not tested yet, #3)*.

**User interface**
- Replay window and node simulation output: readable font and size at high display scale.
- Start-up message boxes say BUSMASTER-NG.
- The round application button of the ribbon shows the BUSMASTER-NG logo, sharp at every display scale, instead of
  the old BUSMASTER bitmap.

**Replay**
- Log files are played back at their recorded speed: delays below 1 ms are added up instead of being rounded up
  to 1 ms each (original pull request 768 by PBjore, issue 1270); in cyclic replay with the recorded delays each
  message now waits its own delay, not the one of the previous message *(not tested yet, #5)*.

**Test automation**
- The Test Suite Executor sets each signal by name, not by position in the database, so the signals of a test
  setup are sent with the right values (original pull request 1116 by itiserik) *(not tested yet, #5)*.

**Diagnostics**
- The UDS window also shows the response as ASCII text (original pull request 1300 by saerpa) *(not tested yet,
  needs an ECU)*.

**Drivers**
- The Ixxat driver is built again (Ixxat VCI V4 SDK); not tested with an Ixxat interface.
- NSI: the driver is restored from the configuration, receives standard and extended frames, and connecting or
  disconnecting twice no longer fails (original pull request 1137 by MelissaA74, issue 1072); the project no longer
  needs a Kvaser library (pull requests 1143 and 1145 by jogo-) *(not tested yet, needs an NSI interface)*.
- PEAK PLIN-USB with one LIN channel works ("Listing hardware interfaces failed" before; original issue 1188, fix by
  janw-cz) *(not tested yet, needs a PLIN-USB)*.

**Package**
- The zip contains the license texts, the node simulation files and this changelog.

**Note on updating**
- Window positions and the last configuration are stored per version, so after updating from 3.3.0 load your
  configuration once (*File → Load*).

## 3.3.0 "Overdrive" - 2026-10-26

First release of BUSMASTER-NG, the community fork of BUSMASTER 3.2.2.

**DBC support**
- **Load DBC** (CAN tab, or Ctrl+Shift+M): DBC databases are converted and associated directly, several at once
  (original issue 586).
- DBC ↔ DBF converters fixed: decimal numbers on Italian / German Windows, large offsets and very small factors
  kept exactly, Motorola and 64-bit signals, value descriptions, files that hung or crashed the converter or came
  out empty. 26 issues of the original project fixed, partly fixed or explained: see
  [docs/dbc-support.md](docs/dbc-support.md).
- The **Format Converter** tool is back (it no longer compiled).

**User interface**
- Sharp display at 125–200% scale (DPI aware): splash, icons, message window, Transmit window.
- Transmit window: resizable with controls that follow it, readable check boxes, negative physical values.
- Dissociate Database: resizable, long paths readable.
- New splash screen, icon and About dialog.

**Reliability**
- A missing or damaged driver DLL no longer makes the program hang at start-up: a message says which file is
  missing and why.
- The trace window shows the right text.

**Under the hood**
- Built with Visual Studio 2022; a Windows 7 compatible toolset is used for the package.
- Configurations (`.cfx`) of BUSMASTER 3.2.x open unchanged.

**Known limitations**
- The database engine `DBManager.dll` is a closed binary of the original project: factor/offset with about 7
  significant digits, IEEE float signals shown as raw values, no CAN FD messages in databases, multiplexed signals
  always all shown.
- Japanese resources are not maintained; the help still has images of the original BUSMASTER.
